# Introduction/Business Problem
The business problem being solved by this project is to help a business in Winston-Salem, NC find areas where it would be good to open a new coffee shop. 
My son works in the coffee industry and he is partnering with a businessman. This information will help them to identify areas where a new coffee shop is needed. The analysis will look at existing coffee shop locations and identify an area (or areas) where there are less dense coffee shop locations and where a coffee shop might best be located. 

# Data
The major source of data to be used for this project is from the Foursquare location data. Other datasets may be used in combination with the Foursquare location data, such as zipcode lookup data. 
## Foursquare Data
The Foursquare location data will be filtered for coffee shops to find their locations. Depending on availability, the services offered by coffee shops or other nearby locations may also be used.

## Geographic location data
Zipcode data may also be used to group coffee shops by locations. If these areas are too large in geographic area, other data (such as neighborhood data, if available) may be used.  Longitude and Latitude data may also be used to determine locations in relation to each other.
