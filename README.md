# Introduction/Business Problem
The business problem being solved by this project is to help a business in Winston-Salem, NC find areas where it would be good to open a new coffee shop. 

My son works in the coffee industry and he is partnering with a businessman. This information will help them to identify areas where a new coffee shop is needed. The analysis will look at existing coffee shop locations and identify an area (or areas) where there are less dense coffee shop locations and where a coffee shop might best be located. 

## Grading Criteria for this project:
Note: this is the final project  of the Coursera Data Science Capstone

In this week, you will continue working on your capstone project. Please remember by the end of this week, you will need to submit the following:

A full report consisting of all of the following components (15 marks):
* Introduction where you discuss the business problem and who would be interested in this project.
* Data where you describe the data that will be used to solve the problem and the source of the data.
* Methodology section which represents the main component of the report where you discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis that you did, any inferential statistical testing that you performed, if any, and what machine learnings were used and why.
* Results section where you discuss the results.
* Discussion section where you discuss any observations you noted and any recommendations you can make based on the results.
* Conclusion section where you conclude the report.

2. A link to your Notebook on your Github repository pushed showing your code. (15 marks)

3. Your choice of a presentation or blogpost. (10 marks)

Here are examples of previous outstanding submissions that should give you an idea of what your report would look like, what your notebook would look like in terms of clean, clear, and well-commented code, and what your presentation would look like or your blogpost would look like:

# Data
The major source of data to be used for this project is from the Foursquare location data. Other datasets may be used in combination with the Foursquare location data, such as zipcode lookup data. 
## Foursquare Data
The Foursquare location data will be filtered for coffee shops to find their locations. Depending on availability, the services offered by coffee shops or other nearby locations may also be used.

## Geographic location data
Zipcode data may also be used to group coffee shops by locations. If these areas are too large in geographic area, other data (such as neighborhood data, if available) may be used.  Longitude and Latitude data may also be used to determine locations in relation to each other.

## Distance data
Distance data may also be used to determine size and coverage of geographic areas and distance between groupings.

## Methodology
section which represents the main component of the report where you discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis that you did, any inferential statistical testing that you performed, if any, and what machine learnings were used and why.

## Results

## Discussion 
discuss  observations  noted and recommendations based on the results.


## Conclusion
